                <p>
                    In academic settings, a prevalent challenge is students' difficulty in maintaining focus and
                    developing
                    effective learning methods. To address this, our proposal centers on creating an integrated study
                    web
                    application that incorporates e-flashcards, a study timer, study music, and customizable features,
                    providing an alternative solution to enhance student’s learning and productivity.
                </p>
                <p> Although productivity apps do exist, a large portion of the apps only have one functionality. Due
                    to this, students have to install and use multiple apps and services to gain access to productivity
                    tools. Opening and closing multiple apps can be a major hassle and it also provides an
                    easy opportunity for students
                    to get sidetracked from their studying.

                <p>
                    Additionally, with the internet’s ease of accessibility, we often find ourselves watching internet
                    videos or
                    scrolling through social media when we are supposed to be studying, working on homework, or simply
                    doing anything important. With our web app, we can tackle this issue by providing a space where
                    users can study effectively and productively while preventing potential distractions.

                <h2>App Description</h2>
                <p>
                    The primary users of the application are college students seeking effective study tools to enhance
                    their learning experience, improve productivity, and establish a structured study routine. The
                    application is also designed with inclusivity in mind, catering to minority users such as
                    individuals
                    with learning disabilities such as dyslexia, ADHD, and visual impairments. Through features like
                    screen
                    readers, voice commands, and customizable fonts, the application provides essential support and
                    accommodations
                    for students requiring additional assistance, ensuring a more accessible and inclusive learning
                    environment.

                    This app will effectively address the need for an accessible productivity application, using a
                    simplistic yet intuitive design coupled with an ad-free
                    experience. Moreover, all where the features of the app will not be barred by monthly
                    fees or subscriptions like its competitors, thus fostering inclusivity. Our web application,
                    although rooted in a similar concept to other websites,
                    will provide a fresh, innovative, and accessible alternative to other flashcard websites, whilst
                    allowing for expansive user customization entailing different study modes, cross-platform
                    compatibility, progress tracking, deck organization, color themes, and more.
