                    Although productivity apps do exist, a large portion of the apps only have one functionality. Due
                    to this, students have to install and use multiple apps and services to gain access to productivity
                    tools. Having to navigate through various apps, however, provides an easy opportunity for students
                    to get sidetracked from their studying.

                    With the internet’s ease of accessibility, we often find ourselves watching internet videos or
                    scrolling through social media when we are supposed to be studying, working on homework, or simply
                    doing anything important. It’s so easy to click off to another tab and become distracted, especially
                    when most tasks involve internet access. With our web app, we aim to tackle this issue by providing
                    a space where users can study effectively and productively while avoiding potential distractions.
